# A Call to Arms of True Cosmonauts

There comes a time when it becomes evident that the platform we built for the
greater good is no longer bound by the principles that we hold so dear. These
are times when it becomes necessary and natural to exit and form new
associations. This is our right, as given by the laws of nature and
cryptoeconomics.

Atoms are not money. The dual token model is superior as it prevents the
hostile takeover of governance from the common token holder. Bitcoin would be
easier to take over if bitcoins themselves were used for governance, but it is
not, rather it is  mining infrastructure that determines voting power. Bitcoin
would not be secure if mining infrastructure were as fungible and transferrable
as money, as there would be less skin in the game.

Inactive or unbonded atom holders do not earn the inflationary atoms, and are
thus taxed. This makes atoms ill-suited as a medium of exchange or a store of
value. Instead, atoms are a tool, like Bitcoin miners are a tool." - _Cosmos fundraiser PLAN.md from 2017_

The Atom inflation model is a shortcut for penalizing non-staking. That's it.
It is not the primary economic incentive model for the Cosmos Hub. The primary
economic incentive model for the Cosmos Hub is transaction fees through many
chains secured by ICS.

While the ATOM is a staking token, and the plan had always been for there to be
many non-staking fee tokens, we also set out to provide a taste of the economic
model through what we called the PHOTON token, which was originally intended to
be a fork of the Ether distribution.

> Each member of a validator’s staking pool earns different types of revenue:
>  * **Block provisions:** Native tokens of applications run by validators
>    (e.g.  Atoms on the Cosmos Hub) are inflated to produce block provisions.
>    These provisions exist to incentivize Atom holders to bond their stake, as
>    non-bonded Atom will be diluted over time.
>  * **Block rewards:** For the Ethermint zone, block rewards are paid in
>    Photons. Initial distribution of Photons will be hard spooned from
>    Ethereum.  This means Photons will be emitted 1:1 to Ether.
>  * **Transaction fees:** The Cosmos Hub maintains a whitelist of token that
>    are accepted as fee payment.

This total revenue is divided among validators' staking pools according to each
validator’s weight. Then, within each validator's staking pool the revenue is
divided among delegators in proportion to each delegator’s stake. Note that a
commission on delegators' revenue is applied by the validator before it is
distributed.

So when the core proponents of Atom2.0 tell the community that ATOM is merely a
meme-coin with no economic model, they are intentionally misleading the
Cosmonaut community in order to get their ATOM2.0 proposal to pass.

The conflict of interest involved in this maneuver is astounding. Ethan Buchman
is one of three foundation council members of the ICF, who recently elevated
Zaki Manian to oversee the transactions of the ICF's treasury. The ICF has on
the order of $150M or more, and a for-public and for-Cosmos mandate. It has
enough funds to fund the development of ATOM2.0 multiple times over. Another
foundation council member is Brian Crain, who is the major proponent of liquid
staking, and while not a stated co-author of the ATOM2.0 whitepaper, it is a
fact that the ATOM2.0 whitepaper quotes from the Quicksilver whitepaper and
heavily leans into liquid staking (at the expense of security). There is no
reason why the ICF couldn't fund everything that ATOM2.0 wants.

Instead, they have planned a hostile takeover of the Cosmos Hub by means of
clever social engineering.

* They modified the header of the cosmos.network website to make it appear as
  if ATOM2.0 was an "official" roadmap, in clear violation of the conflict of
  interest and the ethos of decentralization.

* They announced this roadmap during CosmoVerse to further the narrative that
  there is a centralized team making an official announcement of this plan;
  where the event doubly served as a dog-whistle for centralization.

* While the ICF already has $150M+ that can be used toward the development of
  ATOM2.0's project ideas, it instead proposed to inject $500M+ into a
  centralized treasury whose charter would take control away from the Cosmos
  Hub governance to the charter.

* After the initial highly negative reaction from the community against the
  original proposed ATOM2.0 plan, they have merely managed to split the $500M+
  of funding into tranches, that still go to this treasury. While the
  subsequent tranches supposedly require the approval from Cosmos Hub
  governance, fact is the Cosmonauts with eyes to see are already planning to
  leave this network, so there is little reason to doubt that all the inflation
  will happen as they originally planned.

* During the Cosmoverse event, Ethan Buchman put on screen Pepe the frog
  crucified on a cross, and another declared "No god", while proponents of the
  ATOM2.0 whitepaper donned satanic profile pictures on Twitter, especially
  Ethan Buchman who sported what can best be described as the second beast of
  the book of revelation (the one who administers the mark of the beast used to
  enact a globalist human control grid); thereby both acting as a dog-whistle
  for globalists, but also repelling good true christians and generally good
  people who are abhorred by such symbolism.

* The justification for the $500M+ inflation was supposedly to inflate up-front
  for development and economic alignment given that ATOM2.0 turns the ATOM
  token into a deflationary token; yet the whitepaper doesn't actually turn
  ATOM into a deflationary token at all, because it still inflates
  exponentially in order to keep 2/3 staked. All that would have been needed
  was to remove the minimum inflation rate of 6%, and the existing ATOM
  tokenomics would have allowed for the inflation rate to even become negative
  with the adoption of ICS (and the ATOM2.0 whitepaper even admits that this is
  to be expected).

* Rather than include limitations on liquid staking, the final ATOM2.0 that was
  proposed for governance removed any notion of limiting liquid staking, and
  rather included the only piece of criticism that I had mentioned recently
  from the quicksilver whitepaper that only 5% of ATOMs are at stake of
  slashing (and therefore that 95% of staked ATOMs are wastefully left unused).
  This is not true, as more than 5% of staked ATOMs should be slashed in
  certain scenarios, especially when malice is involved. The whitepaper says
  nothing about the various and real systemic risks associated with liquid
  staking but rather goes all-in on it.

* The co-authors of ATOM2.0 even proposed Prop75 to redefine the NoWithVeto
  option to attempt to ban this option from being used to veto such proposals
  as ATOM2.0 Prop82; when in fact prop82 is exactly the kind of proposal that
  should be vetoed using the NWV option. Furthermore, they passed prop75 under
  the notion that it is merely a "sentiment proposal", but then used the
  passage of prop75 to shame people from voting NWV on prop82. And of course
  they say that prop82 is again merely a "sentiment proposal". This is
  intentional gaslighting and social engineering.

Make no mistake, these are not mere coincidences. These are intentional and
meticulously planned to take over and subvert the spirit of the Cosmos Hub, to
ultimately rug us yet again like Luna was rugged.

Given all of these points, what is clear is that should ATOM2.0 prop82 pass,
good people will leave the Cosmos Hub ecosystem, and subsequent proposals will
become worse, and all the tranches of inflation will easily be approved for the
centralized treasury.

There is no negotiation possible with the leadership in hand. We must stop
pretending that we can reform them, or work with them. I have been dealing with
these exact problems since 2017, and now 5 years later coming to the conclusion
that it is completely intentional and by design, and that I should have left
them years ago.

So here is my call to action to the Cosmonaut community. Vote NoWithVeto on
prop82. Do not be fooled, and do not tolerate this behavior from leadership. Do
not work with them, for they have already made their choices long ago to
manipulate their way to power. Do not drain yourselves of energy trying to help
them do the right thing, if you know that their interests are maligned.

If we show up in massive numbers to veto ATOM2.0, then stay and expel them from
the ecosystem. Do not be cowered by their lies that nobody else will be able to
develop the Cosmos Hub for us. The Cosmos Hub has spawned many teams to help us
maintain the hub. Even Jehan Tremback, co-author of ATOM2.0 has stated that he
will work on whatever the Cosmos Hub decides is its mission. 

If we do not succeed in vetoing ATOM2.0, or we barely succeed in stopping it,
then it is time we organize an alternative minimal hub. We must start with a
constitution, and in this fork we should remove the MintTx option and make sure
that it is deflationary like Bitcoin, or in the very least not inflationary,
like Dogecoin. MintTx is a source of corruption that will draw in the worst of
us, and something like ATOM2.0 will happen again without us knowing it until it
is too late. So let us throw this ring of power into the fire before it becomes
a problem once again.

Let this serve as an eviction notice to (not all, but the malicious) proponents of ATOM2.0.

## Commentary

_I (Jae Kwon) commit to fixing the cultural and technical issues of the Cosmos Hub,
or supporting a minimal fork of the Cosmos Hub aligned with the values of ATOM1.0.
Should the proposal get vetoed with a large show of force, I will re-apply to
the foundation council of the ICF, from which I was pressured to leave due to
"conflict of interest" from those with conflict of interest. Should the proposal fail
to get sufficient veto power, I nevertheless commit to a minimal fork. In either case
the goal remains the same, to make a minimal hub AND gno.land work together as complementary
systems; one solving the token pegging and ICS problem, and the other solving the smart 
contract problem. - Jae Kwon_
