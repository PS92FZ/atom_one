# Atom One Constitution (sentiment proposal)

This is a sentiment proposal for the finalization and future ratification of the [Atom One Constitution](https://github.com/tendermint/atom_one/tree/8d45f928f2de990dd69ed5babd74bd77ed3ca39e)

The Atom One Constitution completes the original vision for the Cosmos Hub,
and defines a clear economic model with ICS1/2A/2B interchain staking to enable thousands of new zones to bloom.
It provides checks and balances much needed by the Cosmos Hub to stay conservative and secure.

If this proposal passes, the Atom One constitution will be finalized with additional input from the community and expert lawyers. The final constitution will then require another proposal vote to ratify. The spirit of the latest draft 
as linked here will be preserved.
