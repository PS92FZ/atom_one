This is a proposal to adopt a minimal constitution, ATOM ZERO.

Definitions:

 * two thirds supermajority: where more than 2/3rd of all participating staked
   ATOMs votes YES and the vote is above the current governance quorum value,
   as of when the voting period has concluded. ABSTAIN votes do not count
   toward the two thirds supermajority.

Atom Zero Constitution:

Proposals with the following elements require a two thirds supermajority to pass:

   a. any changes to tokenomics beyond what is already implemented.
   b. any inflation of tokens beyond the default inflation of ATOMs.
   c. any changes to the governance process.
   d. any adoption of a constitution (except this minimal constitution).

Until the governance mechanism is changed to reflect this new constitution, a
proposal that requires a two thirds majority as defined above but do not pass
with a two thirds supermajority will be deemed to have failed, even if they
pass with a simple majority according to existing logic.

If this proposal passes with a simple majority, the proposals that are
concurrent with this proposal (especially the ATOM ONE and ATOM2.0 proposals)
shall require a two thirds supermajority to be deemed to have passed.
