This is a proposal to adopt a minimal constitution defined here.

Atom Zero Constitution:

Definitions:

 * two thirds supermajority: where more than 2/3rd of all staked ATOM voters
   vote YES and the participation rate is above the current governance quorum
   minimum limit, as of when the voting period has concluded. ABSTAIN votes
   count as NO votes for the purpose of supermajority calculation.

Article Zero:

Proposals with the following elements require a two thirds supermajority to pass:

 * any changes to tokenomics beyond what is already implemented (besides bug fixes).
 * any inflation of tokens beyond the default inflation of ATOMs.
 * any changes to the governance process.
 * any adoption of a constitution (except this minimal constitution).

Until the governance mechanism is changed to reflect this constitution, a
proposal that requires a two thirds majority as defined above but does not pass
with a two thirds supermajority will be deemed to have failed, even if they
pass with a simple majority according to existing logic.

If this proposal passes with a simple majority, the proposals that are
concurrent with this proposal (especially the ATOM ONE and ATOM2.0 proposals)
shall require a two thirds supermajority to be deemed to have passed.
